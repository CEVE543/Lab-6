# Lab 6: Why Uncertainty Matters

**Date:** October 3, 2025 | **Module:** 1 | **Week:** 6

## Overview

This lab extends the concepts of extreme value analysis and uncertainty quantification beyond rainfall to broader applications in coastal engineering and risk assessment. Students will explore how extreme value analysis applies to coastal flood risk, work with depth-damage curves, and understand how uncertainty propagates through complex systems.

## Topics Covered

- Extreme values with depth-damage curves
- Coastal flood applications of extreme value theory
- Uncertainty propagation beyond rainfall analysis
- Risk assessment methodologies
- Economic impact modeling under uncertainty

## Objectives

- Apply extreme value analysis to coastal flood risk assessment
- Understand uncertainty propagation through depth-damage curves
- Explore broader applications of uncertainty quantification
- Connect statistical methods to real-world decision-making contexts

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab provides broader applications and context for uncertainty quantification methods, demonstrating the wide applicability of the techniques learned in Module 1. While not directly required for PS completion, it reinforces the importance of uncertainty analysis in engineering decision-making.
